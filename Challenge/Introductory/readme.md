#Python Zip Function

The purpose of zip() is to map the similar index of multiple containers so that they can be used just using as single entity.
Unzipping means converting the zipped values back to the individual self as they were. This is done with the help of “*” operator.


##Syntax : 
zip(*iterators)
##Parameters : 
Python iterables or containers ( list, string etc )
##Return Value : 
Returns a single iterator object, having mapped values from all the
containers.
