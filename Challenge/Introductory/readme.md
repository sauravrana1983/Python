# Python Zip Function

The purpose of zip() is to map the similar index of multiple containers so that they can be used just using as single entity. <br/>
Unzipping means converting the zipped values back to the individual self as they were. This is done with the help of “*” operator.

## Syntax : 
zip(*iterators)
## Parameters : 
Python iterables or containers ( list, string etc )
## Return Value : 
Returns a single iterator object, having mapped values from all the containers.

### Sets
A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements <br/>
Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. <br/>
Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets.  <br>
Note: to create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary
